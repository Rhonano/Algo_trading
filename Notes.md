Features of stockpredictionai
1. Correlated assets (competitors, global economy...)
2. Technical indicators (classic indicators, moving average, momentum...)
3. Fundamental analysis (Sentiment analysis using Neural language processing)
4. Fourier transforms (eliminate random walks)
5. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA, maybe outdated)
6. Stacked autoencoders (Neural Network with several layers of sparse autoencoders)
7. Deep Unsupervised learning for anomaly detection in options pricing (Self Organizing maps)

Important steps:
1. Statistical checks for quality of the data. Heteroscedasticity, multicollinarity, serial correlation
2. Create feature importance. Filter unimportant features with XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
3. Create Eigen portfolios using Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionalty created from autoencoders
